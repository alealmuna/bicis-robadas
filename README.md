# geodjango-project-template

A template for a Django project that uses geodjango

## Get the code
Create a new repository in github for your django project.
Clone your repository into your computer.
Add the django-project-template github repo as a remote repository:
* `git remote add template
  git@github.com:magnet-cl/django-project-template.git`
Pull the code from the project template
* `git pull template master` (there may be conflicts with your README.md file,
  fix them and continue)
Push to your own repo
* `git push origin master`
Now you have your own django project in your repository

For a quick start, run 
* `./quickstart.sh`
It should install all the dependencies you need to start the project

Configure your database settings in config/local_settings.py

## Quickstart
Then run `./reset.sh` to reset the database. Pass it the -s argument to start
the server.

## Features

### Base: 
Base is the first application of this project template.

* Custom models:
    * BaseModel: An abstract django model that all your models should inherit
      from. Contains the following methods
       * `update(self, *kwargs)`: updates in the database only the fields you
         pass in the keyword arguments
    * User: Custom user model that inherits form
      django.contrib.auth.models.User. This enables easy customization like
      adding new fieds or new methods. 
       * Simple email system to send templated emails.
       * Custom Backend for email authentication instead of username
         authentication
* Fixtures: Fixtures with an admin user
* Admin: A basic configuration for the admin

### Fabric
It includes basic fabric tasks. These tasks are described later.

## Fabric tasks

In order to use fabric to deploy a gunicorn+nginx configuration you must set
the following variables at `fabfile/config.py`:
* `env.server_root_dir`: Remote path of deployment.
* `env.server_git_url`: Your git repository.
* `env.server_domain`: Server domain of target server. (optional)
* `env.hosts`: Default host used by fabric. (optional)

and add a private ssh key file (id_rsa) to `fabfile/templates` named
`ssh_key`. This file will be put in the remote server as the default ssh key
for the remote user.

To get a list of the available tasks run: `fab -l`. 

Make sure to run the following task before any other task in any of the these
formats:
* `fab config.set_host`: Uses the host specified in `env.hosts` and `magnet`
  as user.
* `fab config.set_host:examplehost`: Manually specify host.
* `fab config.set_host:examplehost,user`: Manually specify host and user.
